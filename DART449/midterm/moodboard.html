		<div class="moodboardCaption">This is the website of the turkey producers of Canada. If you take the subway, you’ve probably seen their recent  advertisements. Frankly, I think it’s strange that there are ads that just remind you that turkeys exist. It’s also interesting to have a look at the workings of this kind of market. Apparently, they consider chicken, beef and pork as their main competitor. There is no way that turkey can replace all of those, right?</div>

		<div class="moodboardCaption">This is a website financed by the egg producers of Canada. It’s very interesting to see how much power and influence these industries have. WHen I used to watch television, there were often advertisements for dairy and eggs. ( “Le beurre, on peut pas s’en passer!”) In the US, the dairy industry lobbied the government to have a whole category in the Food Pyramid. Dairy isn’t a food group anymore, since the Food pyramid has been replaced by My Plate. Looking back, it’s kind of hilarious that the USDA suggested that human health depended on cow milk. These kinds of websites try to appeal to the consumer by displaying appetizing and appealing photos.</div>

		<div class="moodboardCaption">This is the website of Sea Shepherd, a radical activist group that protest against illegal or unethical exploitation of sea resources. They use violent and striking imagery of dead animals to evoke shock and pity. Overall, the website is quite sober. </div>
