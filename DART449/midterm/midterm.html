					<h1 class="bigH1">At current levels of overfishing, all exploitable fish populations will collapse before 2048.</h1>
					<p>The possible collapse of marine ecosystems is one of the terrifying prospects of this century. It is estimated that marine ecosystems house 15 percent of all known biodiversity on Earth. The estimates for people who depend on fish for sustenance range from 1 billion to 3.3 Billion (WWF). For those people, the health of marine ecosystems and their biodiversity is not only a ethical and altruistic concern, but an existential one. <br><br>
					Although Canadians are percieved environmental practices, Canada's fisheries are doing worse than we think. </p>

					<h1 class="bigH1">In 2019, only 29.4% of Canadian fish populations are considered healthy.</h1>

					<h1 class="bigH1">With this environmental issue in mind, the proposal for the final project is a satirical website.</h1>
					<p>The website would be in the style of public relations websites that represent various agricultural producers (for example: eggs.ca or turkeyfarmersofcanada.ca). It is set in a near future in which the fisheries have already started. Despite going further offshore, boats come back with fewer fish. The rising price of seafood means there is less and less demand for what has become a luxury. In the face of this threat, the Canadian Council of Professional Fish Harvesters has financed an ad campaign targeting the public. My midterm website would pose as this cry for help: "the Canadian fishing industry needs your support."</p>
