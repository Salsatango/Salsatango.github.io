			<p><span class="fish">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The 2049 fishing season is almost over. For over 72,000 Canadian workers in the fishing industry, this means finding other occupations until the ice melts again. However, many of us wonder if we'll have a job to come back to next Spring. </p>

			<p><span class="fish">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This November, the flagship of the Canadian fishing fleet, the factory trawler Queen Elizabeth II has come back to it's mooring in Halifax. After a month-long journey at sea, she had less than a ton of catch in its freezers. This is less than a hundredth of the expected yield.  </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text3 text appearOnScroll rellax" data-rellax-speed="-1.05">
			<p><span class="fish">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The low yield of the Queen Elizabeth is not an isolated incident. Throughout the season, all vessels have reported poorer catches than usual. For smaller vessels that operate with smaller margins, this is extremely problematic. A large part of the economy of the Maritime provinces is highly dependant on the products of the fishing industry. Fish and other sea food are one of Canada's largest food exports. The collapse of this sector would be disastrous for our economy in general and will affect all of us. <br> </p>

			<p><span class="fish">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With the support of allies from the food industry and of the Maritime provinces, the Canadian Council of Professional Fish Harvesters is launching the "Save Our Fishing Industry" program.  <br><br>
			This year, the CCPFH has expanded its fundraising campaign to allow for citizens to donate directly to help the cause. In addition, We have drafted a plan for the federal government to commit 5 billion dollars over five years to support our fishing industry and have increased our lobbying efforts with the cabinet of prime minister Jean-Baptiste Trudeau to make this plan a reality. <br><br>For the first time this season, the CCPFH has collaborated with industry partners to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime. We are announcing an online auction for some of the rarest items in seafood history. While most items are in the upper price range, there are listings for every budget. All the proceeds go towards the help fund.
