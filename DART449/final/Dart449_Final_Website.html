			 <p class="introP"> This is a satirical website. It is set in a near future, in which the worst scenarios predicted by climate scientists have become reality. Here is the scenario.
				 <br>
				 <br>The year is 2049. For those of us who remember, there was a hope in the beginning that the new Millenium would bring an Era of prosperity for all. As we near the halfway point of its first Century, there isn't much of that left. The last few decades has been marred by incessant catastrophes. Disputes over basic ressources like food and water has heightened internation tensions and made civil unrest more frequent, even in developped countries. The desertification of equatorial regions has forced millions to become refugees in more livable countries. Last year, another calamity has struck us. Fishing boats, despite going further than ever offshore, came back with fewer and fewer fish. Our biggest factory-ship, the Queen Elizabeth II, has trawled the Atlantic sea for four weeks and came back with less than a few tons of baitfish. This is not an isolated incident; all international commercial fisheries have reported tonnages under their estimates.
