			 <p class="introP"> This is a satirical website. It is set in a near future, in which the worst scenarios predicted by climate scientists have become reality. 
				 <br>
				 <br>The year is 2049. For those of us who remember, there was a hope in the beginning that the new Millenium would bring an Era of prosperity for all. As we near the halfway point of its first Century, there isn't much of that left. The last few decades has been marred by incessant catastrophes. Disputes over basic ressources like food and water has heightened internation tensions and made civil unrest more frequent, even in developped countries. The desertification of equatorial regions has forced millions to become refugees in more livable countries.<br> <br>  Last year, another calamity has struck us. Fishing boats, despite going further offshore than ever, came back with fewer and fewer fish. Our biggest factory-ship, the Queen Elizabeth II, has trawled the Atlantic sea for four weeks and came back with less than a few tons of baitfish. It is not an isolated incident; all international commercial fisheries have reported tonnages under their estimates. <br> Does this mean the end of the fishing industry?

			<h1>The Canadian fishing industry needs your help.</h1>

			<p>The 2049 fishing season is almost over. For over 72,000 Canadian workers in the fishing industry, this means finding other occupations until the ice melts again. However, many of us wonder if we'll have a job to come back to next Spring. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="text2 text appearOnScroll">
			<p>This November, the flagship of the Canadian fishing fleet, the factory trawler Queen Elizabeth II has come back to it's mooring in Halifax. After a month-long journey at sea, she had less than a ton of catch in its freezers. This is less than a hundredth of the expected yield.  </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text3 text appearOnScroll">
			<p>The low yield of the Queen Elizabeth is not an isolated incident. Throughout the season, all vessels have reported poorer catches than usual. For smaller vessels that operate with smaller margins, this is extremely problematic. <br> </p>

		<div class="text4 text appearOnScroll">
			<p>Small operations fisherfolk are hit especially hard by this mysterious dissapearance of fish. Tom, who has lobstered in Nova Scotia since he was a boy, poses in front of his traps that have been empty all season.</p>

			<p>What can you do to help?</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="text6 text appearOnScroll">
			<p>With the support of allies from the food industry and of the Maritime provinces, the Canadian Council of Professional Fish Harvesters is launching the "Save Our Fishing Industry" program.  <br><br>
			This year, the CCPFH has expanded its fundraising campaign to allow for citizens to donate directly to help the cause. In addition, We have drafted a plan for the federal government to commit 5 billion dollars over five years to support our fishing industry and have increased our lobbying efforts with the cabinet of prime minister Jean-Baptiste Trudeau to make this plan a reality. <br><br>For the first time this season, the CCPFH has collaborated with industry partners to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime. We are announcing an online auction for some of the rarest items in seafood history. While most items are in the upper price range, there are listings for every budget. All the proceeds go towards the help fund.
