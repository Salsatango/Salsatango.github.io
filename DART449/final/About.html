			<p> Despite not yet knowing the causes of this disastrous fishing season, we can still be proactive. Here are some of the ways your money helps the men and women in the fishing industry.   </p>

			<p> Unfortunate fish harvesters lose their nets and traps at sea and are unable to recover them. These are expensive pieces of equipment and their loss represent a non-insignificant financial burden. Hundreds of tons of fishing gear are lost this way. Drifting in the waves, these nets are a danger to boat propellers and sometimes cause further financial damage. </p>

			<p> According to the FAO, Canada’s fisheries aren’t the only ones affected by this bad fishing season. Due to these new pressures, foreign fishing vessels have been spotted dangerously close to our territorial waters. There have even been cases of ships invading our sovereign waters and plundering our fisheries. In addition, as international tensions continue to increase over the resources of the sea, our own fleet needs escorts as they need to go further and further offshore to look for fish. </p>

			<p> The rise in the price of diesel has hit the fishing industry hard, especially as we had to go further and further offshore. To survive, the maritime industry needs to find alternative sources of fuel. Our engineers have theorized that petroleum byproducts could be burnt and used as replacement for refined diesel. With enough funding, we could engineer engines that could run on these unwanted derivatives of the petrochemical industry that contain too many impurities to use as fuel presently.<br><br> If fish populations remain as elusive in the next years, we will need bigger nets that ever before, that go deeper and catch as many animals as possible. With enough financial support, we could fund exploratory expeditions to find yet unexploited fish populations. </p>
