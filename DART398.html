					<h1 id="paragraph1" class="paragraph1 colorGroup1 hide">This is the final project for a bookmaking class taught by M. Wright at Concordia university titled "Un.bound in Perfect Print." It was in the Winter semester of the year 2020, and it was a strange year already. A global pandemic was ravaging the world and Justin Trudeau told us to stay home. This project was supposed to be something completely different, but the circumstances made me change it into a web-design project.  </h1>

					<p id="paragraph2" class="paragraph2 colorGroup2 hide">It was the Ides of March, and I ventured outside. I wanted to print some labels for a personal project at Copies Concordia. It was sunny, but there was a crip wind that slapped you in the face and made your cheeks kind of numb. There were a lot of people downtown. The seriousness of the situation hadn’t set in yet. </br> <span class= "larger">***</span></p>
					<p id="paragraph3" class="paragraph3 colorGroup2 hide">  In the city where I was born, BenXi, there were people with little carts full of books. They would roam the neighborhoods and yell at the windows that they were selling books. Sometimes, they would even go door to door. My mom bought me two books with a lot of pictures. And so, the first book I read was an encyclopedia of animals. The second book I read was about dinosaurs. I think this was in 1997-1998. I cut some of the animals out, and I was sad to find that this ruined the contents on the other side. </br><span class= "larger">***</span></p>

					<p id="paragraph4" class="colorGroup3 hide">This is Guy-Concordia Metro station, where you got off when you went to Concordia. It was very convenient, because you didn’t have to go outside during the Winter, as the university was connected to the station by tunnels. It was like this at Université de Montréal too, but as UdeM was up the mountain, there was a giant escalator that conveyor-belted students up the slope. The escalator kept breaking. Like in a fairy tale, every day the school would repair it during the night, and the weight of the students would break it during the day. They wanted to repair it for good during the summer break, but the escalator killed someone. They shut that tunnel down for two (2!) years and we had to scale the mountains using the old worn out concrete steps.</br><span class= "larger">***</span> </p>

					<p id="paragraph5" class="colorGroup4 hide">Against the wise advice of many people to not start watching the Netflix sensation “Tiger King” late at night, I started at 11pm and binged watched it  in one sitting. When I finished, it was five in the morning and I had a pounding headache. I still couldn’t sleep though, because I wanted to do as much research as possible about the unlikely characters in the show. It kinda really made me want to become vegetarian.

I read Hemingway’s “Farewell to Arms” and “A Moveable Feast” last year. I haven’t read in a while because my Kindle is broken. Those books felt very real because they were based on his own life, I think. I wonder if all great stories are inspired by something real. I heard people wanted David Spade to play Joe Exotic in the inevitable film adaptation.

This is the new beach in Verdun. I grew up near here, and I came here often to catch small fish for fun but there was no beach yet. The trick is to put the butterfly net behind them and scare them with your other hand. They have the reflex of swimming away behind them, but the net will be there to catch them. Crayfish are especially easy to catch with this technique. As with all decapodes from the order Caridea, they have what is called a “caridoid escape reaction.” They quickly retract their tails in order to quickly propel themselves backwards. While wading in the water, I saw a huge carp, at least three feet long, grazing on the mossy gravel in the shallows. I tried to grab it, but it was just too slimy.
