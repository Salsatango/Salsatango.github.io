---
this book is about a lot of things and perhaps a bit all over the place. It ended up being about my childhood, about the places I've been, about books and stories. I thought this project was a good opportunity to hone my coding skills. I've always found writing code to be a mystical thing, something you see computer "nerds" in movies do.<br>

I didn't know until recently that you could use emojis in both the code and the URL. I like it.

It was in the Winter semester of the year 2020, and it was a strange year already. A global pandemic was ravaging the world and Justin Trudeau told us to stay home. This project was initially something else, but the circumstances made me change it into a web-design project. Here are some thoughts I had during the first two weeks of quarantine. </h1>

					<p id="üìñüìñ" class="üìñüìñ colorGroup2 üôà">It was the Ides of March, and I ventured outside. I wanted to print some labels for a personal project at Copies Concordia. It was sunny, but there was a crip wind that slapped you in the face and made your cheeks kind of numb. There were a lot of people downtown. The seriousness of the situation hadn‚Äôt set in yet. Not a lot of people were wearing masks, and I remember people smirking at those who did.  </br> <span class= "üç∞">***</span></p>
					<p id="üìñüìñüìñ" class="üìñüìñüìñ colorGroup2 üôà">  In the city where I was born, BenXi, there were people with little carts full of books. They would roam the neighborhoods and yell at the windows that they were selling books. Sometimes, they would even go door to door. My mom bought me two books with a lot of pictures. And so, the first book I read was an encyclopedia of animals. The second book I read was about dinosaurss. I think this was in 1997-1998. I cut some of the animals out, and I was sad to find that this ruined the contents on the other side. </br><span class= "üç∞">***</span></p>

					<p id="üìñüìñüìñüìñ" class="colorGroup3 üôà">This is Guy-Concordia metro station, where you got off when you went to Concordia. It was very convenient, because you didn‚Äôt have to go outside during the Winter, as the university was connected to the station by tunnels. It was like this at Universit√© de Montr√©al too, but as UdeM was up the mountain, there was a giant escalator that conveyor-belted students up the slope. The escalator kept breaking. Like in a fairy tale, every day the school would repair it during the night, and the weight of the students would break it during the day. They wanted to repair it for good during the summer break, but the escalator killed someone. They shut that tunnel down for two (2!) years and we had to scale the mountains using the worn-out outside concrete steps.</br><span class= "üç∞">***</span> </p>

					<p id="üìñüìñüìñüìñüìñüìñ" class="colorGroup4 üôà">Against the wise advice of many people to not start watching the Netflix sensation ‚ÄúTiger King‚Äù late at night, I started at 11pm and binged watched it  in one sitting. When I finished, it was five in the morning and I had a pounding headache. I still couldn‚Äôt sleep though, because I wanted to do as much research as possible about the unlikely characters in the show. It kinda really made me want to become vegetarian. 
					</br><span class= "üç∞">***</span></br>
					I read Hemingway‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell to Arms‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Moveable Feast‚Äù last year. I haven‚Äôt read in a while because my Kindle is broken. Those books felt very real because they were based on his own life. I wonder if all great stories are inspired by something real. I heard people wanted David Spade to play Joe Exotic in the inevitable film adaptation. 
					</br><span class= "üç∞">***</span></br>
					This is the new beach in Verdun. I grew up near here, and I came here often to catch small fish for fun but there was no beach back then. The trick is to put the butterfly net behind them and scare them with your other hand. They quickly retract their tails to quickly propel themselves backwards, but the net will be there to catch them. Crayfish are especially easy to catch with this technique. As with all decapodes from the order Caridea, they have this ‚Äúcaridoid escape reaction.‚Äù  While wading in the water, I saw a huge carp, at least three feet long, grazing on the mossy gravel in the shallows. I tried to grab it, but it was just too slimy.

				<p id="üìñüìñüìñüìñüìñüìñüìñ" class="colorGroup5 üôà">This is my shrimp tank. It is stocked with around 200 Neocaridina davidii. This species of freshwater shrimp comes from South Asia. They are very small, with the biggest being only an inch long. The blue variety however, tends to stay half that size. The females are generally larger than the males and carry their fertilized eggs under their ‚Äúskirt.‚Äù They keep them oxygenated by fanning fresh water over them with their pleopods. </br><span class= "üç∞">***</span></br>
				Towards the end of the 19th Century, Erik Satie composed his ‚ÄúTrois Gymnop√©dies.‚Äù As he was very avant-garde, he composed the first and the third in 1888 and the second one in 1895. I discovered this music on a Youtube channel called ‚ÄúFoo the Flowerhorn.‚Äù It features relaxing videos of a person taking care of his tiny fish.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen it, it‚Äôs pretty popular. 
				</br><span class= "üç∞">***</span></br>
				I‚Äôve been reading this book titled ‚ÄúThe Hero With a Thousand Faces,‚Äù by Joseph Campbell. It says that all our stories are essentially the same, or at least follow the same structure. I can think of many stories that are like that. Maybe the stories themselves don't matter as much as he act of telling? </br><span class= "üç∞">***</span></br>
